# Project 2 of Hacking With SwiftUI

## About the Project

A flag guessing game! It includes features like keeping track of the user's score, resetting the game after reaching a max number of questions, styling the flag and the general UI of the screen.

This project covers topics like using stack to arrange views (stacks like VStack, HStack, ZStack), Color, Frames, Buttons, Images, Gradients, and showing alert messages.

Xcode, SwiftUI

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install XCode

### Getting the files onto your computer

Clone this repository to a desired location on your computer using Git or GitHub Desktop. 

For example, this is how using git could potentially look like: 
```
https://github.com/your_username/project_name.git
```

You should replace `your_username` and `project_name` respectively.

### Running the project

1. Get started by opening up the project in XCode by clicking on the file ending with `.xcodeproj`.
2. Once the project is open in Xcode, you can select a device (ex. iPhone 15) and run it on a simulator by pressing Cmd + R or clicking on the play button at the top-left corner of the screen.

This project is from a tutorial series provided by Hacking With Swift. The tutorial series is called 100 Days of SwiftUI. Part 3 introduces challenges where I made additions with my own code.
